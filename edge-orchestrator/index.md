## 1. How does it work? {#como-funciona}

By using Azion as your Edge Computing platform, you can create services and manage your edge nodes.

The Edge Orchestrator modules provide the tools that you use: Edge Nodes and Services. You need at least the activated Edge Nodes module in order to use the product and, to ensure the scalability of your infrastructure and applications, we recommend that you activate them all.

After contracting the product, you must register at least one *Edge Nodes* and activate more modules, if desired. Some of Azion's own services can be activated by default, but to activate the module that allows you to register your personalized services, you must activate the *Edge Services* module. 

All services linked to edge nodes, will be orchestrated and configured from the moment the device is authorized via Real-Time Manager. The orchestration order is executed sequentially and respects the dependencies between resources and triggers necessary for the configuration.
