# Account Deletion

[Edit on GitHub]

**Real-Time Manager** allows you to delete your account. Here are some guidelines on how to do it.

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);

2. Go to *Client Account* menu on the top right corner, select  *Account info*;

3. Click the *Delete account* button on the bottom of the page;

4. An account deletion window will open with the following information:

   - *Deactivate DNS zones*
   - *Delete all Edge Applications*
   - *You have $500,00 in open debits* (here is an example, the information may vary)

   > The *Delete account* button will be activated only when the information mentioned above has been resolved.

5. Click on the *Delete account* button; 

Done! Your account has been deleted.

When you delete your account you will be redirected to the account creation main page – you can create a new account if you wish. The following message will be displayed: *Your account has been successfully deleted*. 

You will also receive an email confirming the deletion of your account. If you want to give feedback on your experience with Azion, contact us through [this e-mail.](feedback@azion.com)

> Your account information will be stored in case future conferences are needed. You can create a new account and continue your experience with Azion at any time.
