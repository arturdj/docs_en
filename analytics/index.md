The Metrics screen has some regions which enable you to filter information, such as:

* Area to filter your data interval: Where you can select either the period or domain you would like to be displayed.
* Data Area: Where the graphs with the requested data are displayed.

## 1. Filter Data Interval {#filter-data-interval}

Every graph options of Metrics products have a Data Interval Filter.

In same graphs it's possible to filter by domain.

The graphs are updated and present the information according to the criteria selected in the filter.

---

## 2. Export to CSV {#export-to-csv}

After applying the filters, you can export the information to a CSV file, to perform this action, click on the CSV icon next to the desired graphic.

## 3. How to Interpret the Graphics {#how-to-interpret-the-graphics}

The information is presented according to the solution and the time interval selected in the filters, the graphs presented are grouped in:

---

## 4. Data Transferred {#data-transferred}

This tab presents graphs with the information referring to the volume of data transferred by the domain you selected. This tab presents 4 graphs referring to the volume of data transferred in the domain and in the selected period, as follows:

**Edge Caching:** This graph shows the sum (Saved Data + Missed Data) of the volume of data trafficked in the domain and in the selected period, hover over the graph to see the exact value trafficked in the period.

The values displayed at the bottom of the graph are the sum of the volume in the range.

**Edge Offloaded:** This graph shows the percentage of the volume of data that was delivered by the Azion solution, that is, it is the representation of the Saved Data graph only in percentages, hover over the graph to see the exact percentage in the selected range.

The values displayed at the bottom of the graph are the averages in the range.

**Saved Data:** This graph shows the volume of data that was delivered by Azion's servers, in other words, without searching for content on the origin server, hover over the graph to see the exact value of the period.

The values displayed at the bottom are the sum of the volume of the range.

**Missed Data:** This graph shows the volume of data that was delivered by the origin server, in other words, the request was made to Azion's servers, but the content had not been transferred from the origin to them. In the moment the originating server fulfills the request, it also sends the content to Azion's servers.

The values displayed at the bottom of the graph are the sum of the volume in the range.

**Bandwidth Usage**

**Total Bandwidth Usage:** Number of Mbps used by the band. At the bottom of the graph shows the average of the band used in the interval.

**Bandwidth Offload:** Percentage of bandwidth that was downloaded.

At the bottom of the graph shows the average of the band used in the interval.

**Saved Bandwidth:** Number of Mbps of the band that was delivered by CDN without having to search the content on the origin server.

At the bottom of the graph shows the average of the band used in the interval.

**Missed Bandwidth:** Number of Mbps of the band, up to the origin server of the content.

## 5. Requests {#requests}

**Total Requests:** Number of customer requests to the content. At the bottom of the graph shows the sum of requests for the interval.

**Saved Requests:** Number of requests that were delivered by Azion's servers, that is, without searching for content on the origin server. At the bottom of the graph we have the total number of requests delivered in the interval.

**Missed Requests:** Number of requests that were delivered by the origin server, in other words, the request was made to Azion's servers, but the content had not been transferred from the origin to them. At the bottom of the graph we have the total number of requests for the origin in the interval.

**Requests per Second**

**Total Requests per Second:** Number of customer requests to the content per second at the bottom of the graph we have the average number of requests per second in the interval.

**Requests per Second Offloaded:** Percentage per second of requests that were delivered by Azion's servers, that is, without fetching content from the origin server. In the footer we have the average in the interval.

**Saved Requests per Second:** Number of requests per second that were delivered by Azion's servers, that is, without searching for content on the origin server. At the bottom of the graph we have the average number of requests delivered in the interval.

**Missed Requests per Second:** Number of requests per second that were delivered by the origin server, in other words, the request was made to Azion's servers, but the content had not been transferred from the origin to them. At the bottom of the graph the average number of requests per second in the interval is shown.

## 6. Status Codes {#status-codes}

This tab presents graphs with information regarding the Content Delivery Status codes. 

Excellent documentation to deepen your knowledge of HTTP Status Codes can be found at this link: [List of HTTP Status Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) . Only available in Metrics Premium.

| 503  | **Service Unavailable:** Server is not available. Usually a temporary Status. |
| 5xx  | **Server Error:** Here you can find other types of Status of requests that also generated errors but that are not quite common. |

## 7. HTTP Methods {#http-methods}

This graph shows the requests for your site segregated by the HTTP method used. For more in-depth information about HTTP methods you can read through this URL: [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) .
