Whenever you have a problem, please open a ticket using our ticket system. We need the following information so that we can react quickly:

* Which URL, in your Azion set up, are you having problems with?
* What is the normal behavior? What is wrong?
* In what situation did the problem occur? (Browser, application, operating system, internet operator, type of connection with the internet)
* What are the steps to recreate the problem?
* Using the device that is giving problems, go to URL http://netinfo.azion.com and note the value that appears next to the UUID field.
